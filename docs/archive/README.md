# 📦 Archived SAAN Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that was created during the development and implementation phases of the SAAN system.

## 📁 **Archive Structure**

### **implementation-plans/**
Contains original planning documents and implementation guides:
- Service architecture planning
- Feature implementation roadmaps  
- Integration strategy documents
- Technical decision records

### **service-reports/**
Contains completion reports and refactoring summaries:
- Implementation completion reports
- Refactoring summaries and outcomes
- Service migration reports
- Technical debt resolution records

## 📚 **Why Archived?**

These documents were moved to archive because:

✅ **Implementation is Complete**: All services are now built and operational  
✅ **Focus Shifted**: Current documentation focuses on API usage, integration, and maintenance  
✅ **Historical Value**: Preserved for architecture decisions and future reference  
✅ **Cleaner Structure**: Active documentation is now service-centric in `/docs/services/`
